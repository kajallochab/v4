<h3>For Gujcost Robofest 3.0, a multi-locomotion hexapod robot</h3>Collaboratively built a hexapod robot for education and inspection purposes. It has 3D mapping, obstacle avoidance, and a modular base for easy upgrades. We used AI integration for gas detection, Python GUI development for real-time data monitoring, and OpenCV for tracking the following. The robot is lightweight, efficient, and has a high payload capacity.
